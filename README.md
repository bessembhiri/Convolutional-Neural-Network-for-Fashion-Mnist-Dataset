# Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Fashion-Mnist-Dataset
We implement a Convolutional Neural Network for solving the multiclass image classification problem of Fashion Mnist dataset
https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist. We also Tune the Hyperparameters of the choosen model:

- First we investigete three diffrent architectures of CNN, we choose the one with the best validation accurraccy
- Secondly we tune the hyperparameters of the chossen Architecture CNN.
